# ðŸ“¸ Screenshots â€“ Network Traffic Analysis

This folder contains terminal and Wireshark screenshots captured during the execution of **Project 2: Network Traffic Analysis using Zeek and Wireshark**.

These screenshots provide visual evidence of:
- ðŸ§ª Simulated traffic (ping, curl, dig, nmap)
- ðŸ§  Zeek running in monitoring mode on `eth0`
- ðŸ›  Live packet capture in Wireshark using filters like:
  - `dns`
  - `http`
  - `tcp.port == 4444`
